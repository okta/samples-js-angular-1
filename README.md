## Introduction

This repository contains the Angular 1 front-end code that can be used by our full end-to-end samples.

If you're only interested in the front-end code, you can run this as a standalone demo by using the built-in Express backend. To see the full end-to-end scenarios with a different back end, pair this front end with our full end-to-end samples. These samples also provide more documentation around the scenarios.

## Using the built-in Express server

For more information about the scenarios implemented in this sample, check out the [Express sample documentation](https://github.com/okta/samples-nodejs-express-4#express-and-angular-1-sample).

To run this sample:

1. Clone this repository and navigate to the new directory.

    ```bash
    $ git clone git@github.com:okta/samples-js-angular-1.git && cd samples-js-angular-1
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies.

    ```bash
    [samples-js-angular-1]$ npm install
    ```

3. Run the mock Okta server. If you're interested in testing this sample against your own Okta org, follow the steps in the [Express Quick Start](https://github.com/okta/samples-nodejs-express-4#quick-start).

    ```bash
    # Starts the mock-okta server at http://127.0.0.1:7777
    [samples-js-angular-1]$ npm run mock-okta
    ```

4. In a different terminal window, run the Express server.

    ```bash
    # Starts the sample back end on http://localhost:3000
    [samples-js-angular-1]$ npm start
    ```

5. You're all set! Open a browser window to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Using a different back end

To run the full sample integrated with a different back-end web framework or language:

1. Clone one of our end-to-end samples:

    - [Express 4 (NodeJs)](https://github.com/okta/samples-nodejs-express-4)
    - [Django (Python)](https://github.com/okta/samples-python-django)
    - [Flask (Python)](https://github.com/okta/samples-python-flask)
    - [Spring MVC (Java)](https://github.com/okta/samples-java-spring-mvc)
    - [Dropwizard (Java)](https://github.com/okta/samples-java-dropwizard)
    - [ASP.NET MVC (.NET Core)](https://github.com/okta/samples-dotnetcore-aspnetmvc)
    - [Scotty (Haskell)](https://github.com/okta/samples-haskell-scotty)


2. Follow the end-to-end sample setup instructions

3. Install this front end in the cloned directory

    ```bash
    # Install the front end. For example, if using Django:
    [samples-python-django]$ npm install @okta/samples-js-angular-1 --save
    ```

4. Follow the end-to-end instructions to run the web server. You should be up and running with Angular 1!
